# About this project
This project is made from html and css. It was an easy project that takes 30min- 1hr depending on your skill. I used vscode to make this animation of SVG using html and css. This is a project were I animated a picture of a person riding a bicycle. This is my first project so it may have a couple of thing I need to fix.
